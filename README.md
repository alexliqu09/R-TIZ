## üìö Description

R-tiz's main idea is to present a platform that houses the Art community and that has as its standard the use of Artificial Intelligence and that is available to all types of users. The system will allow users to use interesting tools made with OpenCV and IA, Also the software will have a gallery system where our users can store and publish their images, so that anyone interested in seeing images of other artists can do so from our software service.
